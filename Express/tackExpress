   [1mDescription[0m
       npm gets its config settings from the command line, environment variables, [1mnpmrc [22mfiles, and in some cases, the [1mpackage.json [22mfile.

       See npm help npmrc for more information about the npmrc files.

       See npm help config for a more thorough explanation of the mechanisms involved, and a full list of config options available.

       The [1mnpm config [22mcommand can be used to update and edit the contents of the user and global npmrc files.

   [1mSub-commands[0m
       Config supports the following sub-commands:

   [1mset[0m
         npm config set key=value [key=value...]
         npm set key=value [key=value...]

       Sets each of the config keys to the value provided. Modifies the user configuration file unless [1mlocation [4m[22m‚ü®/commands/npm-config#location‚ü©[24m is passed.

       If value is omitted, the key will be removed from your config file entirely.

       Note: for backwards compatibility, [1mnpm config set key value [22mis supported as an alias for [1mnpm config set key=value[22m.

   [1mget[0m
         npm config get [key ...]
         npm get [key ...]

       Echo the config value(s) to stdout.

       If multiple keys are provided, then the values will be prefixed with the key names.

       If no keys are provided, then this command behaves the same as [1mnpm config list[22m.

   [1mlist[0m
         npm config list

       Show all the config settings. Use [1m-l [22mto also show defaults. Use [1m--json [22mto show the settings in json format.

   [1mdelete[0m
         npm config delete key [key ...]

       Deletes the specified keys from all configuration files.

   [1medit[0m
         npm config edit

       Opens the config file in an editor. Use the [1m--global [22mflag to edit the global config.

   [1mfix[0m
         npm config fix

       Attempts to repair invalid configuration items. Usually this means attaching authentication config (i.e. [1m_auth[22m, [1m_authToken[22m) to the configured [1mregistry[22m.
