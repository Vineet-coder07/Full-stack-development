        Dear Ms. Lester:

Upon learning of your posting for the position of Dean of Students, I felt compelled to submit my resume for your review. As an accomplished, visionary leader in the academic sector with 22 years of operational, planning, and program development experience for educational organizations, I am well prepared to significantly contribute to Wichita Universityâ€™s goals and objectives in this role.

My expertise lies in overseeing strategic planning initiatives, budget administration, and academic program development to propel increased enrollment and retention while enhancing student achievements and learning experiences. From conceptualizing and establishing forward-thinking development plans and programs to driving grant development and community outreach initiatives, I excel at directing strategic enhancements to drive goal achievement while communicating openly and routinely with faculty, staff, student, and management teams.

Highlights of my experience include the following:

Leading comprehensive responsibilities pertaining to student-centric program development and engagement throughout 11-year tenure as the Dean of Students for Atlanta Academy.

Spearheading academic program design, curriculum development, grant and funding initiatives, staff training and leadership, and data / best practice analyses to propel academic program success.

Establishing a variety of innovative academic programs to attract and retain students, energize academic offerings, and enhance career and professional development outcomes for students.

Achieving a PhD in Educational Administration and a Master of Science degree in Developmental Education.

My skills in academic operational oversight and directional leadership have been finely honed, and I am confident my additional strengths will readily translate to your environment. The chance to offer more insight into my qualifications would be most welcome. Thank you for your consideration; I look forward to speaking with you soon.

Sincerely,

Linda J. Thomas
